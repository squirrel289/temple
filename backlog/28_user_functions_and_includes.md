# User Functions and Includes

## Goal
Support `{% function name(args) %}...{% endfunction %}` and `{% include "path" %}` primitives.

## Deliverables
- Function definition/registry and invocation
- Include resolution (relative to template root), with cycle detection
- Error handling for missing functions/files with positions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Functions can be defined and called within templates
- Includes resolve correctly and compose output
- Diagnostics are clear and mapped to original locations
