notes: |
  Introduce reusable whitespace-control semantics so template authors can
  intentionally trim surrounding whitespace instead of relying on
  markdown-specific cleaning heuristics.
  Started implementation on 2026-02-14 after completion of archived item 77.
  Initial slice: add trim marker semantics to tokenizer, linter cleaning, and passthrough renderer.
  Follow-up refactor anchored trim marker set in shared core utility and
  removed duplicated leading/trailing whitespace regexes from renderer and linter cleaner.
  Added tilde (`~`) parity tests for tokenizer, renderer, and lint-cleaning integration.

## Goal

Implement explicit whitespace-control tokens (e.g., `{{- ... -}}`, `{%- ... -%}`, `{#- ... -#}`) and apply them consistently in both lint cleaning and rendering pipelines.

## Background

Current markdown-specific cleaning behavior mitigates false positives but behaves as a heuristic. This makes behavior harder to reason about and does not generalize cleanly to all base languages. Author-controlled trim markers provide deterministic intent and a reusable cross-language feature.

## Tasks

1. **Define whitespace token semantics**
   - Extend tokenizer/parser contracts to track `trim_left` and `trim_right` around template delimiters.
   - Document default behavior vs trim-enabled behavior.

2. **Implement trimming in lint-cleaning path**
   - Apply trim flags in token cleaning before base lint delegation.
   - Preserve diagnostic mapping guarantees and line/column stability where feasible.

3. **Implement trimming in render path**
   - Apply same trim semantics during rendering output generation.
   - Verify parity between linter-cleaned text assumptions and rendered behavior.

4. **Compatibility and migration behavior**
   - Keep existing templates valid by default.
   - Ensure old behavior remains unless trim markers are used.

5. **Tests and docs**
   - Add tokenizer/parser tests for trim markers.
   - Add linter mapping tests and renderer golden tests for trim behavior.
   - Update README/architecture/docs with examples and migration guidance.

## Deliverables

- Tokenizer/parser support for whitespace-trim delimiters.
- Shared whitespace-trim behavior across linter cleaning and renderer.
- Test coverage for trim semantics and diagnostic mapping outcomes.
- Documentation for author-facing whitespace controls.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `{{- ... -}}`, `{%- ... -%}`, and `{#- ... -#}` parse and execute with defined semantics.
- [ ] Lint cleaning and rendering apply matching trim behavior.
- [ ] Existing templates without trim markers preserve current behavior.
- [ ] Diagnostic mapping remains stable and test-covered under trim cases.
- [ ] Markdown-specific heuristic logic is reduced or isolated behind compatibility fallback.
