## Goal

Create a suite of parity tests and CI checks that validate that Temple-native behavior and adapter behavior (Jinja2 adapter) produce consistent diagnostics for a shared set of template fixtures.

## Deliverables

- `tests/parity/` fixtures and test harness
- CI workflow that runs parity suite on PRs
- Triage checklist for resolving parity mismatches

## Acceptance Criteria

- CI runs parity tests; mismatches report clear diffs
- Parity suite included in repository and documented

## Progress Notes

- 2026-02-13: Added parity fixtures + harness at `temple/tests/parity/` comparing relevant semantic diagnostic codes between native Temple parsing and the Jinja2 adapter.
- 2026-02-13: Added parity execution to CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) and local pre-push validation (`scripts/pre-commit/test-temple-parity.sh`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).
