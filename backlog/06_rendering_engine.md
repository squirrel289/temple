# Implement Rendering Engine (Object Model Input → Output Format)

## Goal
Develop the rendering engine that applies template logic to the normalized object model, producing the final output in the target format.

## Deliverables
- Rendering engine implementation
- Example input data, templates, and outputs
- Support for user-defined functions and custom logic
- Error handling and reporting

## Acceptance Criteria
- Engine supports all logic primitives and user-defined functions
- Output matches expected format and passes linting
- Errors are reported clearly and do not block best-effort rendering
- Example workflows are documented
