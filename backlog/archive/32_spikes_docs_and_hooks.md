# 32 — Docs, Examples & Extensibility Hooks for Spikes

Goal
----
Provide consistent documentation, runnable examples, and well-defined extension points for each spike, to make future exploration and handoff straightforward.

Deliverables
----------
- `docs/spikes/` directory with per-spike README files and API notes
- Example templates (runnable) for each spike under `examples/` subfolders
- A short README describing extension hook interfaces (validator plugin, serializer adapter, include resolver, AST plugin)

Acceptance criteria
-------------------
- Each spike directory contains a `README.md` with quick start instructions and a runnable example
- Extension points are documented with example function signatures and expected behaviors

Tasks
-----
1. Create `docs/spikes/` and add per-spike README files.
2. Add example `README.md` in each `examples/` subfolder for the spikes.
3. Document minimal extension APIs in a single doc under `docs/spikes/hooks.md`.

Reason for archival
-------------------
- Team decided to productionize the typed DSL approach (spike 30) with greenfield implementation rather than spike documentation.
- Production work will include comprehensive documentation as part of feature development, making spike docs unnecessary overhead.
- Spike code remains available for reference; if needed, docs can be added on-demand during productionization.
