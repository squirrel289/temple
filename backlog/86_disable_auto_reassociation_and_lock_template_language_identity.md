  2026-02-16: Implementation completed and moved to testing.
  - Removed runtime reassociation helpers and calls from extension activation flow.
  - Preserved Temple lint activation and base-lint request bridge behavior.
  - Preserved startup default-resolution request fix (`sendRequest(..., {})`).
  2026-02-16: Re-validated and marked completed.
  - Reconfirmed no runtime reassociation path remains.
  - Compile/lint checks remain green in current workspace.

## Goal

Remove runtime language forcing and preserve Temple ownership of template documents.

## Background

Auto-reassociating templated files to base languages causes raw-linter diagnostics
on template source and makes diagnostics ownership ambiguous.

## Tasks

1. **Done**: Removed reassociation helpers/calls in `vscode-temple-linter/src/extension.ts`.
2. **Done**: Preserved filename-based Temple linting path.
3. **Done**: Kept base-lint bridge behavior unchanged.

## Deliverables

- Simplified extension language-mode flow.
- Updated extension logging behavior without reassociation messages.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] No calls to `setTextDocumentLanguage` for Temple templates.
- [x] Opening templated files no longer flips language away from `templ-any`.
