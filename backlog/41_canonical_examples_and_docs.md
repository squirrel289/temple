## Goal

Provide clear, runnable examples and developer-facing documentation for serializers and diagnostics APIs.

## Tasks

- Add `examples/serializer_examples/` with sample templates and expected outputs for each serializer (JSON, Markdown, HTML, YAML).
- Add `docs/serializers.md` describing the `Serializer` API, `SerializationContext`, and extension points.
- Add `docs/diagnostics_api.md` with examples for formatting and mapping diagnostics, and LSP integration notes.
- Add `examples/README.md` with quickstart commands to run examples.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Examples render with local commands and docs pages include usage snippets and links to examples.
